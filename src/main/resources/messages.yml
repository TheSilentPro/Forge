# 'level' represents the amount of fluid contained within this block, either by itself or inside a cauldron.
# In the case of water and lava blocks the levels have special meanings:
# A level of 0 corresponds to a source block, 1-7 regular fluid heights, and 8-15 to "falling" fluids.
# All falling fluids have the same behaviour, but the level corresponds to that of the block above them, equal to this.level - 8
# Note that counterintuitively, an adjusted level of 1 is the highest level, whilst 7 is the lowest.
